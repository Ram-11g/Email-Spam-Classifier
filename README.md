# Email-Spam-Classifier
An Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning model designed to automatically identify and filter out unwanted or harmful emails, commonly known as spam. It analyzes email content—such as subject lines, body text, and sender information—to distinguish between "spam" and "ham" (legitimate emails).
